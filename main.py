## Welcome
### Check out some of my cool projects at on [GitHub](https://github.com/smartycope):

#### [EZRegex](https://github.com/smartycope/ezregex)
- A readable and intuitive way to create Regular Expressions, without having to know any syntax
- [Published on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/ezregex/)
##### It even has it's own website at [ezregex.org](https://ezregex.org/)!
- [Website GitHub](https://github.com/smartycope/EZRegexUI)

#### [Square Packing](https://github.com/smartycope/SquarePacking)
- My attempt to find a better configuration for the "[Square Packing in a Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_packing)"
problem than the best known with RL

#### [AntAI](https://github.com/smartycope/AntAI)
- Me messing around with custom genetic algorithms while I was bored on Christmas break

#### [Mathland](mathland.streamlit.app)
- I hate doing math. I love understanding math! Math is wonderful. But I can't stand doing it by hand.
That's what computers are for. So I wrote a really nice frontend for sympy using streamlit so I never
have to think about how to do math by hand again
- [GitHub](https://github.com/smartycope/Mathtopia)

#### [Membership Estimates](https://github.com/smartycope/app_challenge_membership_fa23)
- A very well laid out final project using Docker, streamlit, polars & PySpark

#### [Rose](https://github.com/smartycope/Rose)
- A relationship evaluation algorithm. *Not* a dating app or anything like that. You set preferences
of what you would like in a significant other, and then you evaluate a potential (or current) prospect,
and it comparse the 2 and tells you if you're being an idiot or not

#### [Cope](https://github.com/smartycope/Cope)
- Home to all the Python code I have that doesn't fit anywhere else, or fits everywhere else. Just a
bunch of functions and classes that I've written that are generally useful, either by me or by others.
- Has a bunch of sub-modules for various libraries I've used and added onto
- [Publsihed on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/Cope)
